<h1>Project Description</h1>
<p>This project targets to provide a free online platform for people to share their travel experience and memories, such as travel locations, stories, weather, and expenses, with the other users in the format of journals, pictures, or videos. Users would be able to post by locations, and they could also see other users' posts under the same location. This platform provides a great opportunity for people to better prepare for their future trips and to document their precious moments during a travel.

<h1>Project Design</h1>
<ol>
  <li>	Technology</li>
  <ul>
<li>	Netbeans IDE</li>
<li>	Spring MVC</li>
<li>	Maven</li>
<li>	HTML</li>
<li>	Database(MySQL)</li>
    <li>  External API</li>    
<li>	I will build up my project in Netbeans IDE using Maven and HTML, and I will use Spring MVC as the main framework as required by the project. We’ve used these technologies together in our past labs, and I believe they could be integrated. Building a database is something new to me, and as for now, I decide to use MySQL since it was something mentioned in class. For the external API, I'm thinking about using an external weather report website so the users could also see the weather at the place they are preparing to go to.

  </ul>
<li>	Use case</li>
  <ul>
<li>	Create profile</li>
<li>	Login </li>
<li>	Edit profile</li>
<li>	Post journal/picture/video</li>
<li>	Check weather at a location</li>
<li>	Comment on posts</li>
<li>	View posts by locations</li>
<li>	View comments by posts</li>
<li>	Delete/edit posts</li>
<li>	Delete/edit comments</li>
<li>	Logout </li>    
</ul>
<li>	Design details:</li>
  <ul>
<li>	On the Home page, users would be able to see a map (not Google Map) with lots of famous travel locations, and they could select the location that they want to enter into to take a closer look. These locations that the users are currently seeing are just some places to start off designing our online platform with, but they will expand as more users are involved and more discussions become active. On the top right-hand corner, users would be able to login or register a new account. 
</li><li>	The login and register buttons on the home page would each lead users to different pages:
</li>
    <ul>	<li>Login page: the user would be able to enter username and password </li>
<li>Register page: the user could create a new account by entering username, password, first name, last name, email address and major/profession
      </li></ul>
      <li>	After users click on a specific location, the system will lead them to the Discussion page for that topic. In the discussion page, users would be able to view all posts in chronological order. Besides this, they would be able to share new posts, and make comments to different posts.
</li>
<li>In the top right-hand corner beside login/register buttons, users will see another button called “My Account”. Clicking on this button will lead them directly to the Account page. In the Account page, users would be able to perform activities listed below:
</li>
    <ul><li>View/edit current information</li>
      <li>View/edit/delete all posts</li>
      <li>View/edit/delete all posted comments</li></ul>
<li>	On each page listed above, users would be able to see a tool bar on top left-hand corner on the page. The tool bar could lead users to Home page.
</li><li>	Above are the design details as now, and they might be changed and removed as the project goes. Meanwhile, additional functions may be added if needed.ol>
</li>
  </ul>
    </ol>
  
<h1>Project Schedule</h1>

</li></ul>
    <li>	Checkpoint 2</li>
 <ul>
<li>	Make sure the login and register functions are completed.</li>
<li>	Make sure all the pages are linked and connected well and correctly</li>
<li>	Create a database to store all users’ information</li>
</ul>  
   <li>	Checkpoint 3</li>
   <ul>
<li>	Finish the post function</li>
<li>	Make sure the like/dislike function can be implemented correctly</li>
<li>	Make sure on the Account page, users could view/edit/delete</li>
<li>	Ensure all the functions are in place and the design is neat </li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<h2>What will the final project look like?</h2>
<p>The final project will look like a simpler version of a Chinese app called Zhihu.</p>

  <h1>Project Justification</h1>
<h2>Novelty</h2>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Complexity</h2>
<p>I think the complexity of this project will be a good showcase of my abilities since it involves the use of different systems and languages. I’ve been exposed to Netbeans, MVC, Github, and Java in the past, but this project will require me to learn some new language and tools, such as HTML, MySQL, and Spring MVC. The project will also integrate part of the knowledge I gained from IST 411. I believe there are lots of challenges await me, but I believe this project will help me better understand what we are learning and strengthen my skill sets.
