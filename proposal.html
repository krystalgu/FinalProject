<h1>Project Description</h1>
<p>This project targets to provide a free online platform for people to share their travel experience and memories, such as travel locations, stories, weather, and expenses, with the other users in the format of journals, pictures, or videos. Users would be able to post by locations, and they could also see other users' posts under the same location. This platform provides a great opportunity for people to better prepare for their future trips and to document their precious moments during a travel.

<h1>Project Design</h1>
<ol>
  <li>	Technology</li>
  <ul>
<li>	Netbeans IDE</li>
<li>	Spring MVC</li>
<li>	Maven</li>
<li>	HTML</li>
<li>	Database(MySQL)</li>
    <li>  External API</li>    
<li>	I will build up my project in Netbeans IDE using Maven and HTML, and I will use Spring MVC as the main framework as required by the project. We’ve used these technologies together in our past labs, and I believe they could be integrated. Building a database is something new to me, and as for now, I decide to use MySQL since it was something mentioned in class. For the external API, I'm thinking about using an external weather report website so the users could also see the weather at the place they are preparing to go to.

<li>	View comments by posts</li>
<li>	Delete/edit posts</li>
<li>	Delete/edit comments</li>
<li>	Logout </li>    
</ul>
<li>	Design details:</li>
  <ul>
<li>	On the Home page, users would be able to see lots of topics of discussion grouped according to their categories, and they could select the topic that they want to enter into to take a closer look. Some of the topics they will see are Photography, Design, Accounting, Technology, Sports…etc. These are just some topics to start off designing our online platform with, but they will expand as more users are involved and more discussions become active. On the top right-hand corner, users would be able to login or register a new account. 
</li><li>	The login and register buttons on the home page would each lead users to different pages:
</li>
    <ul>	<li>Login page: the user would be able to enter username and password </li>
<li>Register page: the user could create a new account by entering username, password, first name, last name, email address and major/profession
      </li></ul>
      <li>	After users click on a specific topic, the system will lead them to the Question page for that topic. In the question page, users would be able to view all posted questions in chronological order. Besides this, they would be able to perform activities listed below:
</li>
 <ul><li>Post questions</li>
<li>Like/dislike questions</li></ul>
<li>	If users see particular questions they are interested in, they could click on the question, and the system will lead them to the Discussion page. In the discussion page, users could see all the responses to this question in chronological order, and they would be able to perform other activities listed below:
</li>
    <ul><li>Post reply</li>
      <li>Like/dislike reply</li></ul>
<li>In the top right-hand corner beside login/register buttons, users will see another button called “My Account”. Clicking on this button will lead them directly to the Account page. In the Account page, users would be able to perform activities listed below:
</li>
    <ul><li>View/edit current information</li>
      <li>View/edit/delete all posted questions</li>
      <li>View/edit/delete all posted replies</li></ul>
<li>	On each page listed above, users would be able to see a tool bar on top left-hand corner on the page. The tool bar could lead users to Home page.
</li><li>	Above are the design details as now, and they might be changed and removed as the project goes. Meanwhile, additional functions may be added if needed.ol>
</li>
  </ul>
    </ol>

<h2>What will the final project look like?</h2>
<p>The final project will look like a simpler version of a Chinese app called Zhihu.</p>

  <h1>Project Justification</h1>
<h2>Novelty</h2>
<p>This idea was generated while I was preparing for the CPA exam. I ran into many problems while studying the exam, but these questions are hard to answer for a normal person not studying Accounting. I tried to search the answers for these questions, but I didn’t really find anything that directly answers my questions. However, people who have taken the CPA exam in the past might have run into the same problems while they were studying, and they would be great resources towards solving these questions. Since as students, we have limited resources and money, a free platform like this can help us when we are studying for a professional exam or preparing to enter a professional career.
</p>
<h2>Complexity</h2>
<p>I think the complexity of this project will be a good showcase of my abilities since it involves the use of different systems and languages. I’ve been exposed to Netbeans, MVC, Github, and Java in the past, but this project will require me to learn some new language and tools, such as HTML, MySQL, and Spring MVC. The project will also integrate part of the knowledge I gained from IST 411. I believe there are lots of challenges await me, but I believe this project will help me better understand what we are learning and strengthen my skill sets.
